India witnessed rapid growth in its urban population subsequent to its Independence in 1947- with the impact rising tenfold after the release of liberalization reforms in the early 90s when the country’s market opened to foreign trade and investment. According to the Census of 1901 the contribution of Indian urban population was only one and a half million whereas it stood at 159.57 million in 2011- rising thus from 6% to 42% (Haque and Patel, 2018).  To characterize and encourage this essential growth in Indian cities the term ‘metro-city’ was assimilated, which from 35 in the Census of 2001 multiplied to 52 in the Census of 2011- housing 42.31% of the nation’s population in 2011 when the total population of the country had surpassed 1.25 billion. These cities that lodged more than 0.52 billion of the population estimated to produce about one-third (32%) of the nation’s total economic output (Gross Domestic Product or GDP) though only occupying 0.2% of the land area (Haque and Patel, 2018). Catalysing the growth of the country as a whole as well as of the statutory towns situated peripheral to these metro cities, the previous three decades has subverted most investment towards the sectoral growth of these cities which ultimately led to the growth of the country’s economic output.

The real-estate and housing sector contributes enormously to this growth as the reforms post liberalization period mobilised 100% FDIs (Foreign Direct Investments) into the developer base, and other township investments in the country (Chadchan and Shankar, 2012b)- especially the metro cities that witnessed the urban boom which appropriated a greater need for housing. Presently, the housing and real estate industry is one of the largest growing sectors in the country which observes and incorporates revisions with morphing buyer prerequisites. Having established a commitment to understanding purchasing trends this study contributes to the same by attempting to understand the manner in which amenities inside and around the unit home affect the house prices in 4 metropolitan cities of India- Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata.
